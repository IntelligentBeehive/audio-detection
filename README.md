# Audio detection

This component contains all the code of the audio analyis and detection.


# The dataset
The data set can be found here:
* [UrbanSound8K](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html) - The dataset

It is important to download these files and put them inside a folder called audio within the root of this project.
This will leave you with ./audio/fold1, ./audio/fold2, .... ./audio/fold10, this will contain the audio files to run the project on.


# Running the project
Make sure the python virtual environment is set to the root of this project.
Then navigate to ./code/runners/main.py and execute the main method, this will run the code on the model.
